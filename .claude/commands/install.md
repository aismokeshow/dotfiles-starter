Use the install-dotfiles agent to handle this request.

Run the complete first-time setup: verify the system, install all CLI tools,
configure shell plugins, symlink configs, and validate the installation.

If the install-dotfiles agent is not available, read the CLAUDE.md in the
project root and follow the First-Time Setup procedure (Steps 0-17).
